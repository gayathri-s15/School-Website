        <p class="da">The transport management system allows the school the schedule the various school routes in an efficient manner. It also allows for the school administrative team to easily delete routes, assign new routes for students, and assign bus supervisors to routes. These tasks when done by a human administrator may lead to errors, plus it can be a time and energy-consuming task. However, when delegated to the transport management system like Fedena, this task is taken care of in an efficient and error-free manner.</p>
